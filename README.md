Hello there! My name is Cayyus (you can also call me Caius), I am learning web development and software development, I use Python mainly, and also know HTML, CSS and Javascript (pretty rough here though). I mostly create tools, app and websites. I am looking to collaborate on software projects as well as web projects too. You can reach me on discord at: cayyus
